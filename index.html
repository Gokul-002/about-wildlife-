            <h2>1. Whale species back from the brink</h2>
            <img src="https://assets.weforum.org/editor/Cef-NUEUN69lOhWTdJZwPwMj8_aLuLSk5W6uXegnnCo.jfif" alt="pic 2">

                An estimated 2 million whales were hunted and killed from the 19th to the mid-20th century for their meat, oil and blubber. <br>Species such as the western South Atlantic humpback were driven to the brink of extinction,  
                <br>leading to a “pause” in commercial whaling in 1986. <br>Shortly after, global trade of whale products was banned and limits were set on subsistence whaling.
                The result? Today, humpbacks are a common sight and have almost returned to their pre-whaling numbers. <br> Grey whales in the eastern Pacific have also enjoyed a resurgence. <br>   
                But there’s more to do: <br> six out of the 13 great whale species are still endangered or vulnerable. Iceland and Norway continue to hunt whales, and Japan also resumed commercial whaling in its waters in 2018.

            <h1>2.The panda as a conservation symbol</h1>
            <img src="https://assets.weforum.org/editor/F-5zehM9GOaR7Bi2l2BDdjUGKozh5UHNGBqn6FJkkaw.jfif" alt="pic2" width="100%" height="100%">
                <p>
                    The latest census in 2014 counted 1,864 pandas in the wild. <br> While not many at all, this is an improvement on the historic low of 1,000 pandas in the 1970s. <br>
                    In 1979, the WWF signed an agreement with China – the first of its kind – to secure the Chinese government’s cooperation in helping to save the giant panda. In the 1980s, WWF-funded research and satellite imagery revealed suitable habitat for pandas around Sichuan Province had reduced by at least 50%. 
                    The nineties saw the introduction of a management plan and a decade of cooperation between the WWF and the Chinese Ministry of Forestry. <br>
                    A lot of human effort still goes into counting panda numbers. <br>Teams of 40 people at a time trek through steep and mountainous bamboo forests to find tracks and traces of panda activity. 
                    <br>
                    The panda has also become a symbol of conservation across the globe, with the WWF adopting the animal for its logo.
